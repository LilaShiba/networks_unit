The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It began as an academic research project in 1969, and became a global commercial network in the 1990s. Today it is used by more than 2 billion people around the world.

The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the internet or controls who can connect to it. Instead, thousands of different organizations operate their own networks and negotiate voluntary interconnection agreements.

Most people access internet content using a web browser. Indeed, the web has become so popular that many people incorrectly treat the internet and the web as synonymous. But in reality, the web is just one of many internet applications [source](https://www.vox.com/cards/the-internet/what-is-the-internet).

# Annotated Reading
Summarize and analyze the sources that you have selected in a short paragraph.You may want to consider the following questions:

- Are there any features that your sources have in common?  
- Are there any ways that your sources are related to one another?
- Which is your most valuable source of inspiration?  Why?
- Which is your least valuable source of inspiration?  Why?

**OR**

# Think Tank
We will divide the media list amongst the class. Each student will read three separate sources. While analyzing said media write on post-it’s:

- Main idea or claim
- Evidence supporting main idea or claim
- Interesting facts

# Daily Ideas and Tasks

### Ideas

Your group should have a google doc that details what was done by whom for everyday of class. This is to track work, to make sure the work load is fair, and to keep a record of ideas. This isn't meant to be busy work or to take a long time. At the end of each class you will be given 5 mins to fill this out and to check the FAQ.

Your ideas are any thoughts- however strange- in connection with class and the end goal of this unit: building a better internet. By the time we get to the last lab you will have several ideas documented about what you want your group to do, what role you want to play, and a deeper understanding of how your team works.

Feel free to keep a notebook.

### SCRUM: Daily Tasks
Your group should have a scrum meeting every class. This is [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcReyRYIMg). At the start or end of each class you will be given 5 mins to fill this out and to check the FAQ.

Feel free to keep a notebook or use digital means: [trello](https://trello.com/)

A good ole whiteboard and post-its works fine too:

![lean2](https://www.lightcastlebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MVP-lean.jpg)

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedbac k for future product development (wiki)

- Go through your notes of ideas for your final product and choose a goal for your startup
- [Formulate an elevator pitch](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chicceo/2013/02/05/how-to-create-an-elevator-pitch/#761ac39861eb) of how you will meet your startup's goal
- Highlight three assumptions your group has and
- Conduct three assumption [tests](https://github.com/kyle1james/9th_grade_boot_camp/tree/master/2#assumption-testing) documenting your interviews
- From your assumption testing notes, create three POV statements with your group
- Outline who will do what for creating the MVP
- Create one MVP with your group



## Empathy Interviews

Empathy interviews are the cornerstone of Design Thinking. Through ethnographic research techniques. 

- Once you have finished your MVP conduct a minimum of three empathy interviews: with the goal of conducting several
- Take notes during and after your MVP interviews
- Highlight three things you want to change based off of your empathy interviews
- Do you need to do more testing? Meet with a teacher to find out
- Outline who will do what for creating the second prototype
- Create the second prototype with your group 


### Assumption Testing

![atesting](https://i.gifer.com/Y4Cu.gif)

Before you decide what to build think about what assumptions are being made. After you’ve identified them… VALIDATE!!! If you’re a higher level manager, you should always ask, “What decisions associated with the product have been tested?” This will allow you to know how many assumptions have been validated in steps like the below.
